### FM Transmitter
I built this for my [communication project](/en/projects/#5-communication-system-fundamentals-project). It captures audio with a microphone and transmits it wirelessly over FM. Iâ€™ll upload the full project details soon.

### MOSFET Switch
I used this circuit to control a high-power pump that works with a weight scale system. It allowed me to safely switch heavy loads with just a small signal.

### Arduino Nano Servo/Robot Arm Driver
I used this driver to control a robotic arm using a variable resistor. It made it easy to test manual positioning and servo response.

### ESP32 12V Control Board
I used this board to control my old RGB LED strip after I lost its original controller. With Wi-Fi control, I could set colors and effects directly.

### Weight Scale (Auto Water Dispenser)
I built this as an automatic water dispenser. The system drops water based on a specific value I set with a knob, making it precise and hands-free.
