### 1️⃣ Electronics I Project
**Integrated Control System for Four-Channel Relays Using Arduino Microcontroller**  
The control of electrical devices and circuits using relays is a fundamental aspect of automation and control systems. Relays act as switches that enable the control of high-power electrical loads with low-power control signals. In recent years, the integration of Arduino microcontrollers with relays has revolutionized the field of home and industrial automation, providing a flexible and cost-effective solution for controlling various electrical devices. This project focuses on the development of a system that allows the control of four-channel relays using an Arduino microcontroller powered by 220 AC. The Arduino microcontroller acts as the central hub for controlling the relays and responding to user inputs or external signals. Safety and efficiency are key considerations throughout the design.

### 5️⃣ Communication System Fundamentals Project
**FM Transmitter**  
Frequency Modulation (FM) transmitters are foundational to modern wireless communication, enabling high-fidelity audio broadcasting and reliable data transmission. Developed by Edwin H. Armstrong in 1933, FM modulates information by varying the frequency of a carrier wave, offering superior noise immunity compared to Amplitude Modulation (AM). FM is widely used in commercial radio, aviation communications, and emergency services due to its robustness in noisy environments.
